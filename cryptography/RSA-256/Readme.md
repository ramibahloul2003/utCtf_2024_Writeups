# 🔐 Challenge — RSA-256

**Description**  
Based on the military-grade encryption offered by AES-256, RSA-256 will usher in a new era of cutting-edge security...  
or at least, better security than RSA-128.  

---

**Solution**  
The challenge ciphertext was a simple RSA instance with weak parameters.  
I solved it using the online tool **[dCode RSA Cipher](https://www.dcode.fr/rsa-cipher)** which allows easy factorization and decryption.

**Flag** 
```python```
utflag{just_send_plaintext}
```
